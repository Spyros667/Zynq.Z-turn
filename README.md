# Zynq.Z-turn

The [z-turn][z-turn] board, is a [Zynq][Zynq] [PCB][PCB], featuring multiple peripherals:

![peripherals](img/z-turn.peripherals.jpg)

Some can be accessed through [Zynq][Zynq]'s [PS][PS] part, while others through its [PL][PL].

## HDMI

In order to find, where the HDMI is connected to, we can reference the [schematics](doc/zturnv2Schematic.pdf).  
According to these, they are connected to the [PL][PL] part (since the [PS][PS] pins are numbered as [MIO_#][MIO]).

![MIO](img/MIO.jpg)

Looking further down [the schematics], we see that the signals pass through an "HDMI transmitter".

![Sil9022A](img/Sil9022A.jpg)

As a result, we have to power up the transmitter. In order to do so, we see that it communicates through the I2C-0 bus, thus we'll need an I2C interface to do so.

I2C-0 is connected to PL as P15 & P16

## Activating Sil9022A

The minimal configuration needed is the following:

1. Raise the `RESETn` signal [to power up Sil9022A]
2. Write `0x00` to register `0xC7`, in order to enable the TPI (Transmitter Programming Interface)
3. Wait for ID to stabilize (at 0x1B-1D, 30).
4. Enable source termination (might be unnecessary, depending on the schematic/ external resistors)
5. Disable TMDS output (at `0x1A`) (default)
6. Switch from D2 to D0 state (at `0x1E`)
7. Enable TMDS output (at `0x1A`)

### Address

![i2c addresses](img/addresses.jpg)

It's important to note that the address is **0x3B**. This derives from **0x76 >> 1**, which means that the datasheet depicts the **8-bit** versions.

![CI2CA](img/CI2CA.jpg)

Needless to say, **CI2CA** has been raised (assuming **R209** is in place).

## Raising RESETn

Searching through the schematics for the **RESETn** pin, we can see it's connected to **MIO51**. (The signal passes first through a **buffer** and then through an **AND** gate).

## Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor, on board, is **LM75B** ([NXP](https://www.nxp.com/part/LM75BD)):

![LM75B](img/LM75B.jpg)

It's an 11-bit ADC (with increments of **0.125**Â°C)

The 7-bit [I2C] address (taken from the previous picture) is **0x49**.

It is connected to **I2C0**, which is connected to **PL** pins P15 & P16. The provided **contraints** file has been set up.

![PL I2C0](img/PL-I2C0.jpg)

The sensor's [temperature] register, is at address **00h**. (It is **2 bytes** long).

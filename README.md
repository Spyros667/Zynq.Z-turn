## Block design

## HDMI

In order to find, where the HDMI is connected to, we can reference the [schematics](docs/zturnv2Schematic.pdf).  
According to these, they are connected to the [PL][PL] part (since [PS][PS] pins would be numbered like [MIO_#][MIO]).

![hdmi pins](img/HDMI_pins.jpg)

Looking further down [the schematics], we see that the signals pass through an "HDMI transmitter".

![Sil9022A](img/Sil9022A.jpg)

As a result, we have to power up the transmitter. In order to do so, we see that it communicates through the I2C-0 bus, thus we'll need an I2C interface to do so.

![I2C-0](img/I2C-0.jpg)

I2C-0 is connected to PL as `P15` & `P16`

![I2C-0.PL](img/I2C-0.PL.jpg)

## Activating Sil9022A

The minimal configuration needed is the following:

1. Raise the `RESETn` signal [to power up Sil9022A]
2. Write `0x00` to register `0xC7`, in order to enable the TPI (Transmitter Programming Interface)
3. Wait for ID to stabilize (at `0x1B-1D, 30`).
4. Enable source termination (might be unnecessary, depending on the schematic/ external resistors)
5. Disable TMDS output (at `0x1A`) (default)
6. Switch from D2 to D0 state (at `0x1E`)
7. Enable TMDS output (at `0x1A`)

### I2C Address

![i2c addresses](img/addresses.jpg)

It's important to note that the address is **0x3B**. This derives from **0x76 >> 1**, which means that the datasheet depicts the **8-bit** versions.

![CI2CA](img/CI2CA.jpg)

Needless to say, **CI2CA** has been raised (assuming **R209** is in place).

## Raising RESETn

Searching through the schematics for the **RESETn** pin, we can see it's connected to **MIO51**. (The signal passes first through a **buffer** and then through an **AND** gate).

![RESET 1](img/RESETn.1.jpg)
![RESET 2](img/RESETn.2.jpg)
![RESET 3](img/RESETn.3.jpg)

## Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor, on board, is **LM75B** ([NXP](https://www.nxp.com/part/LM75BD)):

![LM75B](img/LM75B.jpg)

It's an 11-bit ADC (with increments of **0.125**Â°C)

The 7-bit [I2C] address is **0x49**.

It is connected to **I2C0**, which is connected to **PL** pins `P15` & `P16`. The provided **contraints** file has been set up.

![PL I2C0](img/PL-I2C0.jpg)

The sensor's [temperature] register, is at address **00h**. (It is **2 bytes** long).

![Registers](img/Registers.jpg)

## G-Sensor (acceleration sensor)

Referencing the [schematics](docs/zturnv2Schematic.pdf), the **g-sensor**, onboard, is the [adlx345](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl345.html) from *Analog Devices* ([datasheet](docs/adxl345.pdf)).

![](img/adxl345.jpg)

With **7-bit** address `53h`, over `I2C0`.

It has **3 axis** of 13 bits, which give a **resolution** of **3.9 mg**/LSB.

* Q: Can it detect [variations in earth's gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#Variation_in_magnitude)?
* A: No. **Maximum** variation is around `0.069m/sÂ²` (0.7% â‹… g) while we measure at `0.035m/sÂ²` (0.36% â‹… g) (1/282 â‹… g).

### I2C mode (disabled SPI)

![](img/ADXL-I2C.jpg)

`I2C` communication mode is forced, due to `CÌ…SÌ…` being tied to `VDDIO` (high).


## Resolution

Maximum resolution can be achieved only when measuring around `Â±2 g`.

![](img/G-sensor.sensitivity.jpg)

Settings are through the `0x31` register (named "DATA_FORMAT"), but they default to **full resolution**.

![](img/G-sensor.range_bits.jpg)

![](img/G-sensor.DATA_FORMAT.jpg)

![](img/G-sensor.DATA_FORMAT.2.jpg)

## Sampling rate

With a **default** sampling rate of `100Hz`, maximum sampling rate can be achieved by setting the `0x2C` register to `0x0F` (which translates to **1600 Hz**, due to there being 2 bytes per axis).

![](img/G-sensor.rate.jpg)

![](img/G-sensor.rate.2.jpg)

### Spectral Analysis

DECLINED:
> Doing an FFT only on the 32 samples (at maximum sampling rate) of the FIFO, would provide only 16 bins, which is too low a resolution, especially on the `1600Hz` span.

FUTURE:  
> Spectral analysis of nonuniformly sampled data can be achieved. This would be **ideal**, since it would span (?) the full spectrum of `1600Hz`. Details in the [docs/GDFT](docs/GDFT) folder.

ACCEPTED:  
> Spectral analysis relative to I/O speed. That is, for a `100kHz` I2C speed a `100Hz` sampling rate is accepted.

![](img/ADXL.speed.jpg)

A low data rate of `100Hz` should be preferred, against higher ones, due to the latter introducing noise.

![](img/ADXL.noise.jpg)

[Some] Lower (than `100Hz`) data rates should also be avoided, due to high offsetting, relative to temperature.

![](img/ADXL.temp.jpg)

Low power [operation] should also be avoided as it introduces additional noise.

![](img/ADXL.low_power.jpg)

## Data

Data is stored as 3 sets of 2 bytes, at registers `0x32 to 0x37`. They should be read as a 6-byte burst, to retain concurrency.

## GPIO

The library being used is called [**Gpio-PS**](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841744/Gpio-PS+standalone+driver). [API](https://xilinx.github.io/embeddedsw.github.io/gpiops/doc/html/api/index.html).

(All code has been provided). The general procedure is the following.

Gpio is first **initialized**:

* XGpioPs_LookupConfig() â–¶ Retrieves the addresses assigned to the Gpio-PS controller and the related (parent?) interrupts
* XGpioPs_CfgInitialize() â–¶ Sets the XGpioPs instance's [variables](https://xilinx.github.io/embeddedsw.github.io/gpiops/doc/html/api/struct_x_gpio_ps.html).

Next the **pins are set**:

* XGpioPs_SetDirectionPin() â–¶ Which sets the pin as input/output
* XGpioPs_SetOutputEnablePin()

And written:

* **XGpioPs_WritePin()**

## I2C

The library that'll be used is the [I2C-PS](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841822/I2C-PS+standalone+driver), with the respective [API](https://xilinx.github.io/embeddedsw.github.io/iicps/doc/html/api/index.html).

(All code has been provided). The general procedure is the following.

Initialization:

1. XIicPs_LookupConfig(XIICPS_BASEADDRESS);
2. XIicPs_CfgInitialize(&Iic, ConfigPtr, ConfigPtr->BaseAddress);
3. XIicPs_SelfTest(&Iic);
4. XIicPs_SetSClk(&Iic, IIC_SCLK_RATE);

Reading:

1. XIicPs_BusIsBusy(&Iic)
2. XIicPs_MasterSendPolled(&Iic, const_cast<uint8_t*>(v.data()), v.size(), SLAVE_ADDRESS);  -- Send register address, or an array of bytes (for Page/Offset referencies).
3. XIicPs_BusIsBusy(&Iic)
4. XIicPs_MasterRecvPolled(&Iic, result.data(), result.capacity(), SLAVE_ADDRESS);  -- Read register's values
